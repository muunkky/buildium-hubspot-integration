## Guidelines

### Adding Scripts to `/temp/`
- Use descriptive, specific names
- Include purpose and usage in file header
- Clean up when no longer needed
- Consider promoting to `/utils/` if broadly useful

### Promoting to `/utils/`
Scripts should be moved to `/utils/` when they:
- Have broad utility beyond specific testing
- Are well-tested and stable
- Have proper error handling
- Are documented for reuse

### Cleanup Policy
Scripts in `/temp/` should be:
- Reviewed regularly for continued relevance
- Removed when their specific purpose is complete
- Documented if they solve recurring problems
- Archived if they might be needed again
