                             (b)    may recover damages in the same manner as if the landlord had accepted the tenant’s repudiation of the residential tenancy agreement.

(7)  Subject to subsection (5), a landlord who refuses to accept the repudiation and elects to continue the tenancy may, so long as the landlord has not rented the premises to a new tenant, recover rent accruing under the residential tenancy agreement

                             (a)    in the case of a fixed term tenancy, until it expires, or

                             (b)    in the case of a periodic tenancy, until the termination date.

Termination for substantial breach by landlord

28(1)  A tenant may apply to a court to terminate the tenancy or may terminate the tenancy by serving the landlord with a notice at least 14 days before the day that the tenancy is to terminate where

                             (a)    the landlord commits a substantial breach of the residential tenancy agreement, and

                             (b)    an executive officer has issued an order under section 62 of the Public Health Act in respect of the circumstances that constitute the substantial breach, and the tenant believes on reasonable grounds that the landlord has failed to comply with the order.

(2)  The notice must

                             (a)    be in writing,

                             (b)    be signed by the tenant,

                             (d)    set out the termination date.

(3)  A notice to terminate under this section is ineffective if

                             (a)    within 7 days from the date the landlord receives the notice, the landlord serves the tenant with a notice in writing objecting to the termination on the grounds that the landlord has complied with the order under the Public Health Act or has been granted a stay of the order, and

                             (b)    at the time of serving the notice of objection the landlord has complied with the order or has been granted a stay of the order.

Termination for substantial breach by tenant

                             (a)    be in writing,

                             (d)    set out the reasons for the termination, and

                             (e)    set out the termination date.

(3)  Where a landlord terminates a tenancy for non‑payment of rent, the notice to terminate must state that the tenancy will not be terminated if, on or before the termination date specified in the notice, the tenant pays the rent due and any additional rent that has become due under the residential tenancy agreement as of the date of payment.

(4)  A notice to terminate under this section is ineffective if, before the termination date given in the notice, the tenant

                             (a)    pays all rent due as of the date of payment, if the alleged breach is a failure to pay rent, or

                             (b)    serves the landlord with a notice in writing objecting to the termination that sets out the tenant’s reasons for objecting, if the alleged breach is other than a failure to pay rent.

2010 cW‑12.2 s122;AR 217/2022

Termination of tenancy for damage or assault

30(1)  Notwithstanding section 29, if a tenant has

                             (a)    done or permitted significant damage to the residential premises, the common areas or the property of which they form a part, or

                             (b)    physically assaulted or threatened to physically assault the landlord or another tenant,

the landlord may apply to a court to terminate the tenancy or may terminate the tenancy by serving the tenant with a notice at least 24 hours before the time that the tenancy is to terminate.

(2)  The notice must

                             (a)    be in writing,

                             (a)    details of the damage or physical assault or threat;

                             (b)    a copy of the notice to terminate and the time and date it was served.

(5)  If the landlord has not applied to a court to confirm the termination of the tenancy within 10 days after the termination date and the tenant has not vacated the premises, the termination of the tenancy by notice of the landlord is ineffective and the tenancy is deemed never to have been terminated by notice of the landlord under this section.

(6)  A court may grant an order confirming the termination of the tenancy if satisfied that the tenant has done or permitted significant damage or committed the assault or threat referred to in subsection (1).

(7)  If a court is not satisfied that the tenant has done or permitted significant damage or committed the assault or threat referred to in subsection (1), the court may declare the termination of the tenancy by notice of the landlord to be ineffective and the tenancy is deemed never to have been terminated by notice of the landlord under this section.

                             (b)    vacated the premises and whose tenancy has expired or been terminated.

(2)  A landlord who believes on reasonable grounds that abandoned goods have a total market value of less than the prescribed amount may dispose of the goods.

(3)  Notwithstanding that abandoned goods have a value equal to or greater than the prescribed amount, a landlord who on reasonable grounds believes

                             (a)    that the storage of the goods would be unsanitary or unsafe or would rapidly result in total or substantial depreciation in their market value, or

                             (b)    that the cost of removing, storing and selling the goods would exceed the proceeds of their sale,

may sell the goods by a means and for a price that the landlord believes is reasonable.

(4)  If subsections (2) and (3) do not apply, the landlord

                             (a)    shall store or arrange for storage of the goods on behalf of the tenant until the expiration of the prescribed period after the date of their abandonment, and

                             (b)    afterwards may dispose of the goods by public auction or, with the approval of a court, by private sale.

(5)  If no bid is received for the abandoned goods at a public auction held under subsection (4)(b), the landlord may dispose of the goods.

(6)  No liability attaches to a person for

                             (a)    selling goods under subsection (3) or (4)(b), or

                             (b)    disposing of goods under subsection (2) or (5).

(7)  Where abandoned goods are disposed of or sold under this section, the person acquiring the goods on the disposal or sale acquires the tenant’s interest in those goods and the tenant’s interest in the goods is extinguished.

(8)  A landlord shall, on payment of the landlord’s proper costs of removing and storing the abandoned goods, give up possession of the goods to the tenant or to the person entitled to them.

(9)  A landlord may apply the proceeds of any sale of abandoned goods

                             (a)    to the landlord’s proper costs of removing, storing and selling the goods, and

                             (b)    to satisfy the tenant’s liabilities to the landlord in respect of the tenancy, if the liabilities are established in accordance with the regulations,

and shall pay the surplus, if any, to the Minister.

(10)  The Minister shall retain the surplus on behalf of the tenant for one year and afterwards, if the tenant has not claimed it, pay the surplus into the General Revenue Fund.

(11)  On payment of the surplus into the General Revenue Fund under subsection (10), the tenant’s claim to that surplus is extinguished.

(12)  This section does not apply to goods on premises against which a civil enforcement agency executes an order of possession.

(13)  A landlord shall keep a record of the storage, disposition or sale of goods under this section including

                             (a)    a description of the goods,

                             (b)    the period for which and the location at which they were stored,

                             (c)    in a case where subsection (8) applies, the costs claimed by the landlord and the date on which the goods were returned to the tenant,

                             (d)    where the goods are sold, the particulars of the sale, the amount claimed by the landlord under subsection (9) and the amount, if any, paid to the Minister under subsection (9), and

                             (e)    where the goods are neither returned to the tenant nor sold, the manner in which they were disposed of.

(14)  A landlord shall keep a record referred to in subsection (13) as it relates to particular goods for at least 3 years after the goods were returned to the tenant, sold or disposed of, as the case may be.
